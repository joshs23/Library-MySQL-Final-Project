A sample database of a fictional library is deployed on a azure mysql server and is accessible at https://paveldatabaseapp.azurewebsites.net/. Actions usable on the web page include create, read, update, and delete. The books, location, and authors are also all searchable to help users find the books they are looking for. pages for librarian view, customer view, and checkout page for reserving books are included. 

The web servers are no longer active, this was for a final project in Spring of 2023
